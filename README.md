 **GroqTranslate**
**GroqTranslate** is a simple API service built using FastAPI and LangChain, leveraging the ChatGroq model for language translation tasks. This project demonstrates how to integrate the ChatGroq model into a web service to perform real-time translations of text into various languages.

#### **Features:**
- FastAPI-based API: Provides a RESTful API interface for text translation.
- LangChain Integration: Uses LangChain's powerful prompt and output parsing capabilities.
- Groq Model: Utilizes the ChatGroq model to handle translation tasks with high accuracy.
- Customizable: Easily configurable to support additional languages or modify translation prompts.

#### How It Works:
- Users send a request to the API endpoint with text and the target language.
- The text is processed by the ChatGroq model using a custom prompt template.
- The translated text is returned as the API response.

#### Tech Stack:
- FastAPI: For building the RESTful API.
- LangChain: To manage prompt templates and output parsing.
- ChatGroq: The model used for performing translations.

### Use Cases
- Real-time translation services for applications.
- Language learning tools.
- Integrating translation capabilities into existing applications.
